         <p class="p"> For this assignment we were tasked to make a poster to be advertised to first year students. We were split into teams in order to decide which route we would go down with sure a broad brief. We finally decided on studying and exams. We collectively did some desk and field research to get a better idea of what attracts students our age to a poster <br> <br>
		
		After this we split up and continued on with out research and development of our idea. My final poster is styled to look like a computer scrren as we are in a Technological University and it seemed fitting. With the encouragement from my peers I continued on to make this final piece.
